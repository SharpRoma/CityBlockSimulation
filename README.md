# CityBlockSimulation
# Logic:
- The car has a fuel level. If it is low, the car goes to the gas station. If there is not enough time, it waits for the button to be pressed to refill the tank.
- If the car passes by the police, they randomly brake the car and then release it.
- The brake lights turn on when the car is braking.
- The sound of the engine is different when moving and when idling.
- The car obeys traffic signals.\
# Interface:
- Fuel level.
- Empty tank indicator.
-  Speed.
-  Movement state of the car.
-  Position in the form of coordinates.
-  Circular mini-map with the car represented as an arrow.
-  Ability to rotate the camera.\
# World:
